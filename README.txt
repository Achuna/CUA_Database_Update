Welcome to the Inventory Updater Program 
(By: Achuna Ofonedu)

PURPOSE & OUTCOMES:
The purpose of this program is to gather and read information from the "NEW Inventory Update (Responses)" Excel and compare it with the information in the "True Database of Computers" Excel. By using the unique serial numbers, the program will find the computers in the Inventory Responses that DO NOT EXIST in the True Database and highlight them as RED. The program will then ADD the computers highlighted in RED to the end of the True Database file and highlight the newly added computers as BLUE. In the new True Database, the cells with a background color of RED are duplicates (meaning they appear more than once in the database).

Two new Excel files called "NEW True Database" and "NEW Inventory Updates" will be outputted, containing these changes, in the same directory as the original Excel files.


PREREQUISITES:
The "True Database" and "Inventory Updates" files need to be SAVED LOCALLY on your machine and you will need to use their file paths for the program to work

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Open the “Inventory Updater”.exe application
2) Enter the file path to the “True Database” excel
	Example: C:\Users\Achuna\Desktop\Computer Inventory\TrueDatabase.xlsx
3) Enter the file path to the “Inventory Responses” excel
4) The program will take 2 to 8 seconds (based on the size of the databases)
5) When the program completes, it will tell you where the newly outputted excel files are located on your machine. 

OPTIONAL & RECOMMENDED:
6) Open the new files and copy the updated content to the Google Sheets on Student Share

POSSIBLE ERRORS:
1) File not Found: Make sure you are inputting the exact location of an Excel file. 
2) Premission Denied: If you have ran this program before, make sure you close out the Excel files so the program has read and write premissions to the files
		
ENJOY!!!
